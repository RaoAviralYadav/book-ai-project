# 📚 Automated Book Publication Workflow (AI-Powered)

This project is an end-to-end AI system to automate and enhance the book-writing pipeline. It fetches raw book chapters, spins/rephrases them using LLMs, performs quality review, evaluates output with reinforcement-like scoring, and stores semantic versions for future queries — all wrapped in a beautiful Streamlit interface.
