    "content": "Of course. Here is a rewrite of the chapter, focusing on a more modern narrative voice, visceral imagery, and immersive pacing to make it more vivid and engaging for a contemporary audience.\n\n***\n\n### **Chapter 1: The Sky-Mirage**\n\nThe coral was a knife-edge under Taori’s bare feet, a sun-bleached spine separating two worlds.\n\nBehind him, the vast, untamed Pacific crashed against the outer reef, a constant thunder that sent a mist of salt and foam hissing into the wind. Before him, the lagoon of Karolin lay like a sheet of impossible turquoise, an ocean in miniature, placid and shimmering under the sun. It was forty miles of captive sea, and as of yesterday, it was his.\n\nEverything was his. The shouts of the children chasing crabs along the white curve of the beach, the women mending nets with flashing fingers, the lean-bodied youths learning the warrior’s dance on the packed sand—they were his people now. The silent, empty longhouses, where the ghosts of war canoes still seemed to rest on their rollers, were his to fill.\n\nHe had arrived from the sea like a myth, a man delivered to an island of women and boys, their own warriors lost to a war that had left Karolin defenseless. A king by default.\n\nBut as his gaze drifted from the tranquil lagoon to the hollow eyes of those empty canoe houses, a cold knot tightened in his gut. He turned his back on his new kingdom and faced the northern horizon, the wild, open water that had brought him here.\n\nOut there, somewhere beyond the curve of the world, lay Marua. The island the natives called Palm Tree. A place as beautiful as a fever dream, and now home to nightmares made flesh.\n\nA small voice cut through the roar of the surf. “Taori?”\n\nHe looked down. Little Tari, son of the net-maker, sat cross-legged on the coral, his dark eyes wide with a child’s unfiltered curiosity. Tari knew only that the men were gone, and then, yesterday, a strange boat had appeared out of the north. From it stepped a man sent by the sky-gods and Katafa—the girl who had been stolen by a storm years ago, returned.\n\n“Taori,” the boy repeated, his voice small against the wind. “Who are you?”\n\nThe question struck Taori like a physical blow. Who was he? A name ghosted at the edge of his thoughts, something foreign and hard-edged. *Dick Lestrange.* It felt like a word from a forgotten language, a skin he had shed long ago. He remembered a man with a weathered face and kind eyes, Kearney, who smelled of salt and tobacco. A man who’d carved him little toy ships, so unlike the sleek canoes of the islands.\n\nThen the memories sharpened, focused, beginning on the day the ocean gave him Katafa. She had washed ashore on Marua, a girl from Karolin, teaching him her tongue, her world, renaming him Taori. They had been alone, and it had been enough.\n\nUntil the schooner came.\n\nHe couldn't tell the boy any of this. The story was a poison he kept locked inside. He couldn’t explain the black-toothed smiles of the Melanesian crew, the reek of rum and greed, the sudden, brutal mutiny that had left the white officers dead and their ship a pillar of flame against the sky. He couldn't describe the terror of their escape in Kearney’s old dinghy, the howls of the savages fading behind them as they raced for the open sea, guided only by the faint, luminous glow in the sky that promised an island ahead. Karolin’s lagoon, reflecting the heavens.\n\nThe past was a blur of sun and storm, a life erased and rewritten by the sea. His real life began with Katafa.\n\nHe crouched, his eyes meeting the boy’s. “I am Taori,” he said, his voice softer than he intended. “Just Taori.”\n\nTari’s attention had already snapped elsewhere. “Look! A fish!” He scrambled to his feet and darted away toward a group of children wrestling a small, shimmering net from the shallows.\n\nTaori stood and turned his gaze north again. The child’s question had dredged up the mud. He saw the burning ship, felt the desperate pull of the sail in his hands, heard Katafa’s ragged breathing beside him. And he saw the men they had left behind.\n\nThey had no immediate way to follow. The mutineers had burned their only deep-water vessel. But they were men, and men built things. They would build canoes. Taori knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, that they would look to the horizon. They would see the same lagoon-light that had guided him here, a pale beacon in the night sky. And they would come.\n\nIt was not just his instinct as a survivor, a \"savage\" as the men on the schooner would have called him. It was something deeper, a shard of the man he used to be. The part of him that could think ahead, lay plans, and see the shape of a threat before it had fully formed.\n\nThat was why he’d already sent a boat for Aioma, Palia, and Tafata—three elders, too old for battle but whose hands remembered the art of shaping war canoes. It was why his eyes, scanning the tribe, had counted the youths on the cusp of manhood, nearly a hundred strong. But beneath all the strategy, pulsing like a second heart, was the raw, fierce truth: his love for Katafa. She was his other self, more precious than breath, and those men had threatened her.\n\nThey still threatened her.\n\nA hand fell on his shoulder, warm and firm. He turned. Katafa stood beside him, her dark hair escaping its vine circlet, streaming back in the wind like a banner. Her eyes, luminous and deep, weren't on him. They were fixed on the northern horizon, the same point that held his haunted gaze.\n\n“Look,” she whispered.\n\nAnd there, as if summoned by their shared fear, it began. A subtle stain on the endless blue, a smudge in the sea-dazzle. Slowly, impossibly, it sharpened. An ethereal outline sketched itself against the sky. Palm Tree. Marua. Rising from beyond the sea line, a phantom island bleeding into the blue, a trick of the light, a mirage.\n\nThey stood frozen, her hand gripping his shoulder, as the island they had fled bloomed into view—diaphanous, beautiful, and utterly menacing. The mirage showed none of the horrors it held, only the serene, lovely dream of a tropical paradise. But they saw more. They saw the beach swarming with monstrous shapes from their nightmares. They heard the rum-crazed screams. They felt the heat of the burning ship on their faces.\n\nThe beautiful, terrible vision hung in the air, a warning and a promise. *We are here. We will come.*\n\nAs Taori stared at the mirage, a cold fire ignited in his veins. They had threatened him, that was one thing. But they had threatened Katafa. They had put fear in her eyes. That was everything. For that, there was no forgiveness.\n\nHe knew what those men were. Men without women. They would scan the sea for a prize, for a place to raid, and the sky-mirror of Karolin’s lagoon would be their map.\n\nThen, as quickly as it had appeared, the vision wavered, dissolved, and vanished like a light blown out. The horizon was empty again, just sea and sky.\n\nAs they turned from the outer reef back toward the calm of the lagoon, Katafa pointed. A single canoe was slicing across the turquoise water, heading for them from the southern shore.\n\nIt was the canoe he had sent for. The canoe carrying the builders.\n\nLeaving the sharp coral behind, they walked down onto the soft, white sand of the inner beach, moving together to meet the future that was coming for them."

    "content": "Of course. Here is the chapter rewritten to be more modern, vivid, and engaging, focusing on immersive sensory details, a faster pace, and deeper character perspective.\n\n***\n\n### **Chapter 1: The Ghost on the Horizon**\n\nThe thunder of the outer reef was a constant roar at his back, a wild beast pacing the edge of the world. Salt spray, whipped to a mist by the wind, clung to his skin. But before him, the lagoon of Karolin was a mirror of impossible blue, placid and infinite.\n\nThis was his. All of it.\n\nHe’d only washed ashore yesterday, a ghost from the sea, but already the island had claimed him. The sweep of the white-sand beach, the thatched roofs of the village nestled among the palms, the sleek canoes drawn up like sleeping fish—they were his. The people—women with hibiscus in their hair, laughing children chasing crabs, wiry youths honing their fishing spears—were his to protect.\n\nHis gaze drifted from the tranquil lagoon to the long, empty houses that once sheltered war canoes. A knot tightened in his gut. He turned, his back to his new home, and stared north across the churning, open ocean.\n\nOut there, fifty miles beyond the curve of the earth, lay Palm Tree. An island that haunted his dreams, beautiful and venomous. An island swarming with monsters.\n\nA small voice piped up beside him. “Taori?”\n\nHe looked down. Little Tari, son of the net-maker, sat cross-legged on the coral, his dark eyes wide with a child’s fearless curiosity. Tari knew only that the island’s warriors were gone, swept away in a distant conflict, leaving them defenseless. Then yesterday, a strange man had arrived in a battered boat with Katafa—a girl the island had long thought lost to the sea. The elders were calling him a gift from the gods.\n\nTari, caring little for gods, pointed a small, grubby finger at him. “Who are you?”\n\nThe question echoed in a hollow space inside him. What could he say? *My name is Dick Lestrange. I was a boy, even smaller than you, when I was marooned on that northern island with an old sailor. He taught me the ways of the sea before he died. Then Katafa came, blown in by a storm, and she became my world. She taught me your tongue and gave me a new name. We were happy. Until the ship came.*\n\nThe memories were a searing flash: the glint of machetes, the reek of burning copra and spilled rum, the screams of the white crew as the Melanesian laborers they had brought turned on them. Fire clawing at the sky.\n\nHe couldn't tell the boy any of this. The name ‘Dick’ was a forgotten word from a forgotten language. The sailor, Kearney, was a fading ghost, kept alive only by the memory of the small, intricate toy boats he’d carved for him. For this new man, Taori, life had truly begun the day he met Katafa.\n\nHe knelt, meeting the child’s gaze. “I am Taori,” he said, his voice raspy. “Why do you ask, little brother?”\n\n“I don’t know,” Tari chirped, his attention already snagged by a shriek of excitement from the beach. “Ai, a big fish!” He scrambled to his feet and scampered away toward a group of children wrestling a net from the surf.\n\nDick rose, his eyes drawn north again. The child's question had dredged up the mud. He saw the mutineers on Palm Tree’s beach, their bodies slick with sweat and rage. He felt the bucking of the dinghy as he and Katafa fled into the storm, the island burning behind them. He remembered landing here, yesterday, stumbling onto the sand as the women and children of Karolin surrounded them, their faces a mixture of awe and desperation. They saw a leader. He saw a man running for his life.\n\nThe men on Palm Tree had no deep-water canoes. Not yet. But they were builders. And one clear night, they would see the faint, luminous glow in the southern sky—the reflection of Karolin’s vast lagoon. A beacon. A promise.\n\nThey would come.\n\nIt wasn't just the foresight Kearney had hammered into him. It was a savage instinct, primal and certain. And beneath it all, fueling his fear and forging it into a weapon, was his love for Katafa. She was the other half of his soul, and the thought of those men touching her was an agony that eclipsed everything else.\n\nThat was why he’d sent a canoe at dawn to the southern shore to fetch the three old men—Aioma, Palia, and Tafata. They were too ancient for battle, but their hands remembered the art of carving war canoes from the giant tamanu trees.\n\nA hand settled on his shoulder, warm and firm. He turned. It was Katafa. A strand of her dark hair had escaped its vine-lashing and whipped back in the breeze like a warrior’s plume. Her eyes, deep and knowing, were not on him, but fixed on the exact point he had been staring at.\n\n“Look,” she breathed.\n\nA stain appeared on the horizon. A smudge against the blinding dazzle of the sea. Slowly, impossibly, it sharpened. Lines formed, solidified. As if sketched by an invisible hand, Palm Tree bloomed into view—a phantom island, shimmering and ethereal in the heat, yet terrifyingly real.\n\nIt was a mirage, a trick of the light, but to them, it was a portent. A ghost rising from its watery grave to watch them.\n\nThey stood frozen, her hand gripping his shoulder, their minds thrown back to the nightmare. They saw the horde on the beach, heard the phantom echo of their drunken yells. That beautiful, deadly island was a painting of paradise, hiding the demons within.\n\nAs Dick stared at the mirage, a cold fire ignited in his chest. Hate, pure and clean. They had threatened him, but that was dust in the wind. They had threatened Katafa. They *still* threatened her.\n\nThe logic was brutal and simple. Those men had no women. Here, there were women. The same instinct that drew him to Katafa would draw them across the sea. The lagoon light was a map leading them straight to her.\n\nThe vision of Palm Tree flickered, wavered, and then vanished as if the sea had swallowed it whole.\n\nAs they turned from the empty ocean back toward the calm of the lagoon, Katafa pointed. A single canoe was slicing across the turquoise water, heading for them from the southern beach.\n\nThe builders were coming.\n\nLeaving the jagged coral of the reef, they walked down onto the soft, white sand of the inner beach to meet them, two figures silhouetted against the morning sun, ready to build for war."

    "content": "Of course. Here is a rewritten version of the chapter, focusing on modern prose, vivid imagery, and a more immediate, engaging narrative style.\n\n***\n\n### **Chapter 1: The Sea in the Sky**\n\nThe world split in two at Taori’s feet.\n\nBehind him, the thunder of the outer reef, where the deep Pacific hurled itself against Karolin’s coral shield, sending plumes of spray hissing into the wind. Before him, the lagoon: a forty-mile circle of impossible blue, placid as a lake, a universe unto itself.\n\nAnd it was his.\n\nHe had stood on this same ledge of sun-bleached coral only yesterday, a stranger delivered from the sea. Today, the figures moving along the white curve of the beach were his people. The women dragging nets from the turquoise shallows, the children whose laughter was carried on the breeze, the youths tending the taro patches—they all looked to him. The long, silent canoe houses, empty of the war canoes that had once been their pride, were his to fill.\n\nHe was their chief. Their Taori.\n\nA shadow crossed his mind, as sudden and chilling as a cloud passing over the sun. His gaze drifted from the tranquil lagoon to the empty canoe houses, then turned north, back to the raging sea. Out there, fifty miles beyond the horizon, lay the island they called Marua. Palm Tree. A place of staggering beauty, now swarming with demons.\n\nA small voice piped up from beside him. \"Taori... who *are* you?\"\n\nHe looked down. Little Tari, son of the net maker, stared up at him with the unflinching curiosity of a child. Tari knew only that the men of Karolin were gone, lost to a war that had left the atoll a kingdom of women and children, defenseless. Then, yesterday, Taori had arrived from the northern sea in a strange little boat, bringing with him Katafa—the girl who had been stolen by a storm years ago. The women whispered that the gods had sent him.\n\nHow could he answer the boy? The truth was a story from another world, told in a language he no longer spoke. The name he was born with—Dick Lestrange—was a ghost on his tongue, a word without meaning. He was smaller than Tari when he was shipwrecked on Marua with an old sailor named Kearney. The man had taught him the ways of the sea, how to spear fish and read the winds, and had carved him little model ships, so unlike the sleek canoes of the islands.\n\nHis life had a clear dividing line: before Katafa, and after. Before her, his past was a sun-drenched haze, a blur of seasons and storms. Kearney himself would have faded completely if not for the memory of his hands carving those tiny, intricate ships. Then Katafa had come, blown to their shores, and his world had been set ablaze with color and purpose. She taught him her language, the tongue of Karolin. She gave him his name, Taori. They had loved, and built a life, and it might have been forever.\n\nBut forever had been cut short by the arrival of a schooner, its decks crawling with black-toothed men from the eastern islands, hired to cut timber. They had risen up, slaughtering the white captain and his crew, and set the ship aflame. In the chaos, he and Katafa had escaped in their small boat, fleeing the island as it burned, steering for the faint glow on the horizon that Katafa promised was her home.\n\nHe looked down at the questioning child, the weight of that past settling on him. \"I am Taori,\" he said, his voice softer than he intended. \"Why do you ask, little Tari?\"\n\n\"The big people never answer,\" Tari said with a shrug, his attention already snagged by a group of children laughing as they hauled in a glittering net. \"Look, fish!\" He scrambled to his feet and trotted away, the profound question forgotten.\n\nTaori turned his gaze back to the north. The child’s words had stirred the ashes of his memory. He saw the fire-lit faces on the beach of Marua, monstrous and jeering. He felt again the raw terror and desperate hope as their boat clawed its way out to sea, powered by a stolen sail.\n\nThere was no immediate danger. The men on Marua had no canoes. But they would build them. He knew it with a cold certainty. They were men, and men built. And one day, their eyes would catch the same strange, luminous reflection in the sky that had guided him here—the lagoon-light of Karolin. And they would come.\n\nHe was a product of the islands now, his instincts honed by sun and sea. But the blood of his ancestors still flowed in him, giving him the grim ability to think forward, to see the shape of the future. He saw the hundred or so boys on the beach, their limbs hardening into the strength of warriors. He saw the empty canoe houses. He saw Katafa.\n\nHis passion for her was the fire at the center of his being. She was not just his love; she was his other self, more precious than breath. The threat to her, however distant, was a poison in his veins.\n\nThat was why he had sent a canoe at dawn to the southern shore to fetch Aioma, Palia, and Tafata—three men too old for war, but whose hands held the ancient knowledge of canoe building.\n\nA hand fell on his shoulder, warm and familiar. He turned. It was Katafa. A strand of her dark hair, freed from the vine that bound it, whipped back in the wind like a black feather. Her eyes, deep and knowing, were not on him, but fixed on the northern horizon.\n\n\"Look,\" she breathed.\n\nThe air above the sea line began to shimmer. In the dazzling glare, a stain appeared, a smudge of lavender-grey that slowly deepened and resolved itself. As if sketched by an invisible hand, an island bloomed in the sky—a diaphanous, dream-like image of Marua. The mirage.\n\nThey stood together, her hand resting on his shoulder, and watched the ghost-island hang in the air. They didn't need to speak. They were back there, seeing not the beautiful illusion, but the nightmare it concealed. They saw the glint of stolen steel, the reek of the burning schooner, the rum-crazed yells of the Melanesians. The lovely, silent picture in the sky held a silent scream.\n\nAs Taori stared at the phantom island, a primal hatred hardened his face. They had threatened him, that was nothing. They had threatened Katafa. That was everything.\n\nAnd the threat remained. The vision in the sky was an echo of his own deepest instinct. *They will come.* They had no women, those men. And on Karolin, there were women. He knew, with a certainty that went deeper than thought, that the same hunger that had drawn him to Katafa would one day draw those men across the sea. They would scan the horizon for a prize, and the light of Karolin’s lagoon would be their map.\n\nThen, as suddenly as it had appeared, the image flickered and dissolved. The mirage vanished as if the sea had swallowed a ghost, leaving only the endless, empty blue.\n\nAs they turned from the outer sea, Katafa pointed across the lagoon. A single canoe was slicing through the water, heading for them from the southern beach.\n\nIt was the canoe he had sent for. The builders were coming.\n\nLeaving the high coral ledge, they walked down to the white sand to meet them. The time for waiting was over. The time for building had begun."

Ahead, the lagoon of Karolin lay like a shard of fallen sky—an immense, placid turquoise, so calm the gulls fishing its surface seemed to hang suspended between two heavens.\n\nThis was his kingdom. This forty-mile ring of coral and the impossible blue it held captive.\n\nHe was Taori. Yesterday, he had been a refugee. Today, he was a chief.\n\nHis people were scattered along the white curve of the beach below. Women mending nets, their laughter carrying on the breeze. Children, lean and slick from the water, chasing each other in shrieking games. Youths, on the cusp of manhood, tending to the leafy green *paraka* patches. All of them were his to protect. The canoes drawn up on the sand were his. The silent, empty longhouses, built for war canoes that would never return, were his.\n\nA shadow crossed his thoughts. His gaze drifted from the tranquil lagoon to those empty houses, and then, inevitably, lifted north, past the breakers and out to the vast, empty sea.\n\nOut there, invisible beyond the curve of the earth, lay Marua. Palm Tree Island. A place as beautiful as a fever dream, and now crawling with devils.\n\nA small tug at his wrap. \"Taori?\"\n\nHe looked down. Little Tari, son of the net maker, squinted up at him, his face a perfect brown mask of childhood curiosity. Tari knew only that the war had stolen all the men, leaving the island a wounded place of women and boys. Then, yesterday, a strange outrigger had appeared from the north, carrying a ghost from the past—Katafa, the girl lost to a storm years ago—and this tall, new man. The women whispered the gods had sent him.\n\nTari, untroubled by gods, went straight to the source. \"Who are you?\"\n\nThe question snagged on something deep inside Taori. A flicker of a memory, like a name spoken in a forgotten language. *Dick Lestrange.* The words were alien, tasteless in his mind. He remembered a man with a kind, weathered face and a voice that rumbled like the surf. *Kearney.* The memory was a luminous haze, a past bleached by a sun brighter than any he’d known since. For him, life had truly begun the day Katafa’s broken canoe washed ashore on Marua. She had given him his name. She had given him her language. She had become his world.\n\nAll of that was a story too vast and strange for a child. He knelt, placing a hand on Tari’s small shoulder.\n\n\"I am Taori,\" he said, his voice soft in the island tongue. \"Why do you ask, little brother?\"\n\n\"The big folk never answer,\" Tari said with a shrug, his attention already snagged by a flash of silver in a net being hauled from the shallows. \"Ai, a big one!\" He scrambled to his feet and sprinted down the coral slope, the question forgotten.\n\nTaori stood, his gaze drawn north again. The child's simple query had stirred the ashes. He saw it all with a terrible clarity: the schooner burning against the sunset, its rigging collapsing in a shower of sparks. He felt the jarring shudder of their small boat as it slapped against the waves, Katafa huddled in the bow, her face a mask of grim determination. He heard the drunken victory yells of the Melanesian crew who had mutinied, their dark forms raging on the beach like figures from a nightmare. They had taken the island, and with it, his past.\n\nThere was no immediate danger. The mutineers had burned their only link to the outside world. They had no canoes.\n\n*But they would build them.*\n\nThe thought was a cold certainty. They were men, and they would look to the horizon. And sooner or later, they would see it: the faint, tell-tale blaze in the sky, the reflection of Karolin’s massive lagoon. A beacon for the desperate. A promise of spoils.\n\nHe was a savage in this world, raised by the sea and the sun. Yet the blood of his ancestors, the \"white man\" Kearney had spoken of, gave him a different kind of sight. He could think forward. He could see the shape of the threat before it formed.\n\nBeneath it all, fueling his resolve, was a fierce, protective fire. Katafa. His other self, more precious than his own breath. Vaguely threatened, but threatened nonetheless.\n\nWar canoes. The thought was audacious. Did he mean to meet them at the reef? Or did he imagine something more? To take the fight to them, to gut the danger at its source?\n\nA hand rested on his shoulder. He turned, his heart steadying at the sight of her. Katafa. A lock of her dark hair, escaped from the vine that bound it, whipped back in the wind like a black feather. Her eyes, luminous and deep, weren't on him. They were fixed on the northern horizon.\n\n\"Look,\" she breathed.\n\nHe followed her gaze. A smudge had appeared against the sea-dazzle, a subtle stain in the blue. As they watched, the air began to shimmer and bend. The stain deepened, hardened, and then, as if sketched by an unseen hand, an island bloomed into existence—diaphanous, shimmering, impossibly beautiful.\n\nMarua. Palm Tree. A ghost on the horizon, born of heat and distance and tricks of the light.\n\nThey stood frozen, her hand a warm anchor on his shoulder. They knew nothing of mirages, only that the place of their terror was rising from the sea to watch them. In that beautiful, silent image, they saw the horde on the beach. They smelled the smoke and the stolen rum. They felt the desperate hope that had filled their sail as they fled for their lives.\n\nAnd as Taori stared at the lovely, deceitful vision, a cold rage settled in his bones. They had threatened him. That was nothing. They had threatened Katafa. That was everything. And the threat was not over.\n\n*They will come.* The apparition seemed to confirm it. *They have no women. And here are women. They will see the lagoon light, and they will come.*\n\nIt was the oldest instinct, the one that built walls and sharpened spears. A history he had never been taught, but one he understood in his marrow.\n\nThen, as suddenly as it had appeared, the vision wavered, dissolved, and vanished. The horizon was once again a clean, sharp line of blue.\n\nAs they turned from the outer sea, Katafa pointed across the lagoon. A single canoe was slicing through the turquoise water, heading toward them from the southern shore.\n\nThe canoe builders.\n\nTaori’s jaw hardened. Leaving the high coral ledge, they walked down to the white sand of the inner beach to meet them. The time for watching was over. It was time to build."

They had no canoes.\n\n*But they would build them.*\n\nThe thought was a cold certainty. They were men, and they would look to the horizon. And sooner or later, they would see it: the faint, tell-tale blaze in the sky, the reflection of Karolin’s massive lagoon. A beacon for the desperate. A promise of spoils.\n\nHe was a savage in this world, raised by the sea and the sun. Yet the blood of his ancestors, the \"white man\" Kearney had spoken of, gave him a different kind of sight. He could think forward. He could see the shape of the threat before it formed.\n\nBeneath it all, fueling his resolve, was a fierce, protective fire. Katafa. His other self, more precious than his own breath. Vaguely threatened, but threatened nonetheless.\n\nWar canoes. The thought was audacious. Did he mean to meet them at the reef? Or did he imagine something more? To take the fight to them, to gut the danger at its source?\n\nA hand rested on his shoulder. He turned, his heart steadying at the sight of her. Katafa. A lock of her dark hair, escaped from the vine that bound it, whipped back in the wind like a black feather. Her eyes, luminous and deep, weren't on him. They were fixed on the northern horizon.\n\n\"Look,\" she breathed.\n\nHe followed her gaze. A smudge had appeared against the sea-dazzle, a subtle stain in the blue. As they watched, the air began to shimmer and bend. The stain deepened, hardened, and then, as if sketched by an unseen hand, an island bloomed into existence—diaphanous, shimmering, impossibly beautiful.\n\nMarua. Palm Tree. A ghost on the horizon, born of heat and distance and tricks of the light.\n\nThey stood frozen, her hand a warm anchor on his shoulder. They knew nothing of mirages, only that the place of their terror was rising from the sea to watch them. In that beautiful, silent image, they saw the horde on the beach. They smelled the smoke and the stolen rum. They felt the desperate hope that had filled their sail as they fled for their lives.\n\nAnd as Taori stared at the lovely, deceitful vision, a cold rage settled in his bones. They had threatened him. That was nothing. They had threatened Katafa. That was everything. And the threat was not over.\n\n*They will come.* The apparition seemed to confirm it. *They have no women. And here are women. They will see the lagoon light, and they will come.*\n\nIt was the oldest instinct, the one that built walls and sharpened spears. A history he had never been taught, but one he understood in his marrow.\n\nThen, as suddenly as it had appeared, the vision wavered, dissolved, and vanished. The horizon was once again a clean, sharp line of blue.\n\nAs they turned from the outer sea, Katafa pointed across the lagoon. A single canoe was slicing through the turquoise water, heading toward them from the southern shore.\n\nThe canoe builders.\n\nTaori’s jaw hardened. Leaving the high coral ledge, they walked down to the white sand of the inner beach to meet them. The time for watching was over. It was time to build."
